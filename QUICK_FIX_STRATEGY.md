# ðŸš€ Quick Fix: Disable AI Orchestrator Temporarily

Since the AI orchestrator service has complex dependencies that need major refactoring, let's get your app running immediately with these options:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Solution Options:**

### Option 1: Comment Out AI Orchestrator
Simply disable the complex AI features temporarily to get the core app working.

### Option 2: Use Simplified Services
Use the individual AI services directly instead of the orchestrator.

### Option 3: Deploy Core App Only
Deploy without the advanced AI orchestration features first.

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Deploy Strategy:**

1. **Disable problematic services**
2. **Deploy core CRM functionality** 
3. **Add AI features back incrementally**

This gets you a working app NOW, then we can fix the AI orchestrator properly.
