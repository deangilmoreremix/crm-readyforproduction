## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**CRITICAL CODING REQUIREMENT**: Always use user's exact code from design snippets without any modifications, enhancements, or custom styling. When provided with exact code in attached files, implement it precisely as written with zero changes. Do not interpret, optimize, or add functionality - use the exact code structure, class names, and styling as provided.

## Design Preservation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: The AI Goals page and InteractiveGoalCard designs are finalized and must NOT be changed:

- **InteractiveGoalCard Component**: Uses original Goal interface with fields like `businessImpact`, `agentsRequired`, `estimatedSetupTime`, `roi`, `prerequisite`, `realWorldExample`
- **AIGoalsPage Component**: Features enhanced header with glass effects, gradient backgrounds, and structured Card layout
- **Original Design Elements**: All hover animations, backdrop-blur effects, gradient styling, and component structure must be preserved exactly as provided in attached design files
- **Field Mapping**: Goal object structure and property access patterns are finalized and should not be modified

Any updates must maintain the exact visual design and component structure provided by the user.
